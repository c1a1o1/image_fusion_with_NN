# Image Fusion with NN

The VGG19 network come from [elleryqueenhomels' arbitrary_style_transfer](https://github.com/elleryqueenhomels/arbitrary_style_transfer).

And the whole program is also implemented based on [elleryqueenhomels' arbitrary_style_transfer](https://github.com/elleryqueenhomels/arbitrary_style_transfer).

The ideal of this method come from this paper ['Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization'](https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style)

This program is not finished yet.
